Additions and changes:
  Big Endian custom types. You can enable them in settings if you like
  Commonality scanner now also compares the base address. (handy in case it's more than one register)
  translation support for ceshare
  smartedit now also deals with isPointer and isOffset memrecs
  referencedfunctions filter improvement
  PE section display/parsing for addresses
  D3D hook now asks if you're sure you wish to use it (in case of accidental click)

    can now show custom types
    Changing memory protection depends on the selected byte(range)

  Added an option to autosave (in settings)
  Added .netcore support to the dotnet data collector
  Added a syntaxcheck menuoption to the CE lua script window

  When syntax checking an AOBScan script in 64-bit that does an Alloc without prefered base, ask if the user understands that the jmp instruction will be 14 bytes long
  Some extra foundlist preferences
  Find out what access/writes now resolved the address to string (when it has time)
  CEShare now has a list of games that have tables

Fixes:
  Auto Assembler: Fixed getting weird numbers for newmem when using the templates to add new scripts
  Unknown initial value scan for 2GB+ regions failed
  Resolved issue where typecasts where replaced by addresses. (having a memoryrecord named float, would break AA scripts that'd use (float) )
  AMD support for DBVM
  Memoryrecord hotkeys showing up in the settings window as bring to front. Where clicking OK would then set it to that
  Copy paste bug in the form designer
  Hotkeys swapped comma and period on display
  Resolved some issues with the forced module loader, and if it fails, don't freeze CE forever
  AutoAssemble local would fail after opening a process
  Pointermap based rescan
  Assembler: (v)insertps , (v)comiss, (v)blendvp(s/d)

  Lua/Mono: Better support for utf8 strings
  Lua/Mono: Support targets that use mono, but not unity
